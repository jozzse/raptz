 Rapid APT Zysroot (why not)
-----------------------------

Create a system root:

./raptz mkroot <rootfs-path>

Directory structure
-------------------

top-dir
 +- <confdir>            - The name of the rootfs (or sysroot).
    +- raptz.cfg         - The multistrap configuration file
    +- root              - Extra root files for the enviroment
    +- conf              - Configuration files
       +-<nn><name>      - Configuration directory
         +- init.sh      - Optional init script
         +- init.dev.sh  - Optional init script for development


Basics to get a rootfs (raptz mkroot)
=====================================

Step 1 - Install rootfs (raptz mkroot)
---------------------------------

The <confdir>/raptz.cfg file is used when raptz.

Since multistrapping does not setup a complete system (configuration on
target architecture is needed for example) after multistrapping the
<confdir>/root folder is copied to the rootfs. Files are copyed if newer than
the file on rootfs or it does not exist on rootfs.
This move makes them a part of the main rootfs.

After the each directory in <confdir>/conf/ folder is copied to a temporary
directory in the rootfs and it's init scripts will be executed in a qemu
enviroment. The number of the directory name specified the order of execution.
Execution is done within a qemu-static chroot with the temporary directory
included with the first argument.
